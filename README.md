### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - [Tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla): I love this instrument and have been learning for a few years now.
  - Baking: Engaging creatively in the kitchen. My favorite recipes include pound cakes or sweet breads. I work with both Gluten-y and GF ingredients.
    - Highly recommend recipes by [Alanna Taylor-Tobin](https://bojongourmet.com/) for GF desserts.
  - Cooking: Similar to baking, I like experimenting with home-made broths/stocks/soups. I love fresh produce at all times.
  - Watching old sci-fi and new: Babylon 5, Star Trek (Strange New Worlds), For All Mankind

#### What's in the future for me?

- I am wanting to level up in Staff engineering.
- Iâ€™m looking to excel in backend engineering and work on interesting problems in distributed systems space.
- Excited about all things Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, developers.
