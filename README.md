### Hi there - I am Charandas ðŸ‘‹

Originally from India and making a life in the U.S. slowly but assuredly over the last decade.

- ðŸ”­ Technically speaking, I have my eyes on these areas:
  - consensus algorithms / tools (Raft, SWIM, memberlist)
  - background processing platforms, e.g.[temporal.io](https://temporal.io/)
  - concurrent and idiomatic Go
  - Rust: all things Rust (borrow checker, generics, async with Tokio, efficient data structures)
  - [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) and it's impact in K8s
    - I wanna build something basic with [Bumblebee](https://github.com/solo-io/bumblebee), haven't written kernel code in sooo long!
  - All things observability
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning from the following on how to be effective working in teams:
  - [Dignity Model](https://organizingengagement.org/models/dignity-model/)
  - [How organizations are like slime molds](https://komoroske.com/slime-mold/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - [Tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla): I love this instrument and have been learning for a year now.
  - Baking: I love me a heavy dose of engaging creatively in the kitchen. Baking, as a craft, is quite fulfilling. My favorite recipes are often just pound cakes or sweet breads, which I make with both Gluteny and GF ingrediants depending on whom I am cooking for.
  - Cooking: Similar to baking, I do feel invigorated by the act of cooking quite the same. I love fresh produce at all times. These days, I am very much into slightly spicy and bitter greens, nut-based cheeses and savory morning porridge.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/his/him
- Fun facts about my media likes and rants:
  - My favorite TV show of all time is [Fringe]https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/).
  - I am waiting for Andor Season 2.
  - I am sad Henry Cavill is not coming back in Witcher.

#### What's in the future for me? 

- I am wanting to level up in Staff engineering, one step at a time. Here are some resources I am finding helpful:
  - [Staffeng.com](https://staffeng.com/guides/staying-aligned-with-authority)
  - [Staff engineer's path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)
  - [Rand's leadership slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)
- Iâ€™m looking to excel in backend engineering and work on interesting problems in distributed systems space.
