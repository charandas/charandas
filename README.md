### Hi there - I am Charandas ðŸ‘‹

Originally from India and making a life in the U.S. slowly but assuredly over the last decade.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - [Tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla): I love this instrument and have been learning for a year now.
  - Baking: I love me a heavy dose of engaging creatively in the kitchen. Baking, as a craft, is quite fulfilling. My favorite recipes are often just pound cakes or sweet breads, which I make with both Gluten-y and GF ingrediants depending on whom I am cooking for.
    - Highly recommend recipes by [Alanna Taylor-Tobin](https://bojongourmet.com/) for GF desserts.
  - Cooking: Similar to baking, I like experimenting with homemade broths/stocks/soups. I love fresh produce at all times.

#### What's in the future for me? 

- I am wanting to level up in Staff engineering, one step at a time. Here are some resources I am finding helpful:
  - [Staffeng.com](https://staffeng.com/guides/staying-aligned-with-authority)
  - [Staff engineer's path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)
  - [Rand's leadership slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)
- Iâ€™m looking to excel in backend engineering and work on interesting problems in distributed systems space.
- Excited about all things Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, developers and engineering.
